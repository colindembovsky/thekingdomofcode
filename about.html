                    The Kingdom of Code is at the Intersection of Faith and Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the place where we explore how Christians can navigate technology, innovation, and the digital age with wisdom and purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is about understanding the role of technology in God's plan, staying Spirit-led in a rapidly changing world, and using our gifts to shape the future rather than fear it. From coding to creativity, ethics to entrepreneurship, and from the digital to the spiritual, we'll uncover how believers can lead in the age of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join us on this journey as we engage, enlighten, and empower through technology while staying true to our values and faith.
