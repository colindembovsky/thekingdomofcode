  title: "The Origin of Worth: AI, Identity and the Church's Voice"
  description: "As AI accelerates and reshapes how we work, the question of human worth becomes more urgent than ever. In this episode, we reflect on a thought-provoking clip from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who admits he has no clear answers to what gives humans value in an age of intelligent machines. From this launching point, we explore timeless truths rooted in Scripture—from Psalm 139 to 1 Corinthians 12—and draw surprising parallels to the Protestant Reformation. The Church has a vital role in helping people rediscover that our value isn't based on productivity or success, but in being fearfully and wonderfully made. It's time to break down the false divide between the sacred and the secular—and step boldly into every realm of society, including tech."
