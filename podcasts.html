        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-300 max-w-2xl mx-auto">This podcast is at the intersection of Faith and Technology: understanding the role of technology in God's plan, staying Spirit-led in a rapidly changing world, and using our gifts to shape the future rather than fear it. From coding to creativity, ethics to entrepreneurship, and from the digital to the spiritual, we'll uncover how believers can lead in the age of technology.</p>
